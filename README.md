# Walmart Sales Forecast

This is the repository for Walmart sales forecasting. This project involved comparing the accuracy of ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) and the Decision Tree Regression model for predicting the combined future sales for multiple walmart stores.

Below are the descriptions for each file:

* `train.csv`: Walmart dataset used to train and test the forecasting models
* `analysis.py`: Python code used to generate the Decision Tree Regression and ARIMA model
* `Ablation_Study.pdf`: Ablation Study on Decision Tree and ARIMA in Walmart Sales Prediction

Before running the python file `analysis.py`, the following python libraries must be downloaded:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- sklearn
- pmdarima
